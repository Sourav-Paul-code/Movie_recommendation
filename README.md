# Movie_recommendation
I have created Movie recommendation from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ this particular link. where I used ml-latest-small.zip and from I have used only ratings.csv and movies.csv
This Movie recommendation system desinged by the ratings of reviwer. where per 1 movie have minimum of 100 review that are chosen. Upon that I have give Movie recommendation.
Like example of if you watched Forrest Gump (1994), next Movie recommendation will be Good Will Hunting (1997)
This recommendation is based upon corelation between this movie and user ratings.
